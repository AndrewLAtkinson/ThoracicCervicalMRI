This is MRI imaging of my back\n
In this MRI you should note a bony lesion within the T5 vertebrae\n
This has since been diagnosed as a late stage osteoblastoma\n\n\n
Surgical laminectomy and spinal fusion performed by Dr. Phillipe Phan has resulted in almost ideal recovery from pain and osteoblastoma-induced scoliosis\n
