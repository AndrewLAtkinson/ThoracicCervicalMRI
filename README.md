# ThoracicCervicalMRI
This is MRI imaging focusing on my spine

In this MRI you should note a bony lesion within the T5 vertebrae

This has since been diagnosed as a late stage osteoblastoma

Surgical laminectomy and spinal fusion performed by Dr. Phillipe Phan has resulted in almost ideal recovery from pain and osteoblastoma-induced scoliosis
